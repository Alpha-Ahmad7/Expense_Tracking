# Expense_Tracking

In this program i have used the concept of Linklist. 
The algorithm of my program is such tha it consists of Master linklist and other one is sub linklist or data/expense linklist.
Each node of Master Linklist has its own sub linklist that has nodes for each items Type and Amount.

The main Master node consist of two parts Key & Next.
Also the Expense nodes have 2 parts data and next each.
The key of master node has the address of the sub typeNode and further the typeNode has the adress of amountNode.

Working:

The program has some features like:
1- Add Expense
2- Update Expense
3- Display Expenses
0- Exit

Hope you liked it!
