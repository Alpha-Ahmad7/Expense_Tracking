# Expense_Tracking

In this program i have used the concept of Linklist. 
The algorithm of my program is such tha it consists of Master linklist and other one is sub linklist (which stores the expense data).
Each node of Master Linklist has its own sub linklist that has nodes for Each items Type and Amount.

Structure:

The main Master node consist of two parts Key & Next.

Key: it points to the head of the sub-list "typeNode".     
Next: it has the adress of next master node.

the sub linklist or you can say expense nodes also has two parts:

Data: contains items Type or the Amount.      
Next: It has address of next node.

Working:

The program has some features like:   

1- Add Expense    
2- Update Expense   
3- Display Expenses   
0- Exit

Hope you liked it!
